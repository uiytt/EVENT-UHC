# Event-UHC
 A minecraft UHC with a random twist
<br>
<br>
The Event-UHC is a simple UHC where every X amount of time a random event start. These events can go from the harmless speed boost to dangerous one like tnt spawning or teleportation to other players. Some of them are really weird but I will let you discover them.
<br>
<br>
This game is not for players who want a serious game, it's not a fair game but it can be very fun.
